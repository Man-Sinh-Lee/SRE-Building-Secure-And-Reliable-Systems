Chapter 11 of "Building Secure and Reliable Systems" presents a case study on designing, implementing, and maintaining a publicly trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The main sections are summarized as follows:

### 1. **Background on Publicly Trusted Certificate Authorities**
   Publicly trusted CAs are foundational to internet security, issuing certificates for TLS, S/MIME, and other secure communications. These CAs must meet rigorous standards, such as WebTrust and ETSI, and undergo audits and evaluations by various browsers and operating systems .

### 2. **Why Did We Need a Publicly Trusted CA?**
   Google initially purchased certificates from third-party CAs, but three key factors prompted them to build their own CA:
   - **Reliance on Third Parties**: Third-party CAs couldn't guarantee the high safety standards Google required.
   - **Automation Needs**: Google needed to manage thousands of domains and automate certificate issuance, which wasn't feasible with third-party CAs.
   - **Cost**: Given the vast number of certificates needed, it became more cost-effective to operate an in-house CA  .

### 3. **The Build or Buy Decision**
   Google opted to build their own CA rather than buying commercial software, due to:
   - **Transparency**: Commercial solutions lacked the auditability and flexibility Google needed.
   - **Integration**: Building their own solution allowed seamless integration with Google's infrastructure.
   - **Flexibility**: A custom solution allowed Google to adopt new industry standards, like Certificate Transparency  .

### 4. **Design, Implementation, and Maintenance Considerations**
   - **Programming Language Choice**: Google used a combination of Go (for memory safety) and C++ (for performance). Go was chosen to handle untrusted inputs due to its security advantages .
   - **Complexity vs. Understandability**: The CA was designed with simplicity in mind, limiting functionality to necessary operations to ensure understandability and ease of auditing  .
   - **Securing Third-Party and Open Source Components**: Google conducted in-depth security reviews of third-party code and employed containerization to enhance security .
   - **Testing**: Continuous testing, including unit, integration, and fuzz testing, was used to ensure reliability. They employed dedicated exercises to stress-test components  .
   - **Resiliency for CA Key Material**: Google protected the CA's key material with strict access controls and hardware security modules (HSMs). They also maintained alternative key material for recovery purposes  .
   - **Data Validation**: To prevent errors, Google incorporated multiple validation steps and logging mechanisms to ensure consistent certificate issuance .

This chapter highlights the complexities of building a publicly trusted CA, emphasizing security, reliability, and the importance of a simple yet effective system architecture.

**Chapter 4: Design Tradeoffs** from *Building Secure and Reliable Systems*:

### 1. Design Objectives and Requirements
This section emphasizes the importance of understanding both functional (feature) and nonfunctional (security, reliability) requirements. **Feature requirements** are the core functions the system must perform, while **nonfunctional requirements** (such as security and availability) are often emergent properties that influence the design's overall success. The section also presents the example of a Google design document, showing how scalability, redundancy, data integrity, and dependency considerations are outlined  .

### 2. Balancing Requirements
Balancing various system requirements is challenging since security and reliability often emerge from the system’s overall design. The complexity increases when trying to retrofit these concerns into an existing system, making it crucial to consider them during early design stages. For example, Google’s design document provides a structured way to evaluate security and reliability needs early on to avoid costly changes later .

### 3. Managing Tensions and Aligning Goals
In this section, the authors discuss how security and reliability can align with goals for development efficiency and maintainability. For example, by embedding security principles into development frameworks, teams reduce the risk of introducing bugs later. It uses the **Google Web Application Framework** as a case study, where automated processes helped ensure the system was reliable and secure while boosting development velocity  .

### 4. Initial Velocity Versus Sustained Velocity
The final section highlights the tradeoff between **initial velocity** (the speed of early development) and **sustained velocity** (long-term development efficiency). Teams often prioritize fast releases at the cost of ignoring security and reliability early on, which leads to significant issues later. The advice here is to embed security and reliability concerns into the team’s culture from the start to maintain sustained velocity without costly refactoring  .

This chapter emphasizes the importance of balancing feature requirements with emergent properties such as security and reliability to avoid future risks and challenges.

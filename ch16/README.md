Chapter 16 of "Building Secure and Reliable Systems" is about **Disaster Planning**, outlining strategies for anticipating and responding to disasters. The sections are summarized as follows:

### 1. **Defining “Disaster”**
   - Disasters vary in form, from natural disasters to security incidents. Sometimes, minor events like system errors escalate into full-scale incidents. Organizations must define what constitutes a disaster to guide response efforts.

### 2. **Dynamic Disaster Response Strategies**
   - Effective disaster response plans must adapt to a variety of scenarios. Teams should segment their plans into **immediate response**, **short-term recovery**, and **long-term recovery** phases. Regular practice ensures that teams respond naturally under pressure  .

### 3. **Disaster Risk Analysis**
   - Organizations must identify critical operations whose disruption would incapacitate their systems. This involves categorizing systems by mission-criticality and performing risk assessments using a standardized matrix to rank potential disasters by impact and likelihood  .

### 4. **Setting Up an Incident Response Team**
   - Incident response (IR) teams can be dedicated full-time, have IR duties in addition to other roles, or be outsourced. Teams must clearly define roles, such as incident commander, SREs, public relations, legal advisors, and privacy engineers. Effective IR teams require clear severity and priority models to triage incidents and guide decision-making  .

### 5. **Prestaging Systems and People Before an Incident**
   - Configuring systems and training personnel before an incident occurs is essential. Procedures should be defined, including rapid procurement methods, contracts for outsourcing services, and log preservation protocols. Organizations should also stage resources like backup power or servers  .

### 6. **Testing Systems and Response Plans**
   - Testing systems is crucial to identify gaps. This can involve auditing automated systems, conducting tabletop exercises, testing in production environments, and red team testing. Systems must be resilient, and response plans should be updated regularly based on findings from tests  .

### 7. **Google Examples**
   - The chapter discusses real-world examples, including Google's **Disaster Recovery Testing (DiRT)**, which tests emergency access and disaster readiness. An example involved mitigating vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel by proactively patching systems  .

This chapter emphasizes the importance of preparation, adaptability, and continuous improvement in disaster recovery strategies.

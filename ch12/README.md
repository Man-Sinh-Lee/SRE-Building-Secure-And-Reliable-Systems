Chapter 12 of "Building Secure and Reliable Systems" focuses on **Writing Code** and emphasizes security, reliability, and simplicity in software development. Here’s a summary of the key sections:

### 1. **Frameworks to Enforce Security and Reliability**
   - **Benefits of Using Frameworks**: Frameworks promote secure and reliable code by enforcing best practices across multiple applications. They reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities like SQL injections by using hardened libraries and provide common functionality such as authentication, logging, and rate-limiting.
   - **Example: Framework for RPC Backends**: A specialized framework can handle common RPC operations, allowing developers to focus on the business logic while the framework deals with logging, authentication, and error handling.

### 2. **Common Security Vulnerabilities**
   - **Common Security Vulnerabilities**: The text outlines vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), and suggests using types like `TrustedSqlString` to prevent SQL injections by design. 
   - **Preventing XSS: SafeHtml**: For preventing XSS, frameworks like `SafeHtml` are recommended to automatically sanitize inputs in web applications  .

### 3. **Lessons for Evaluating and Building Frameworks**
   - **Simple, Safe, Reliable Libraries for Common Tasks**: Simpler libraries are easier to use correctly and reduce developer friction. Building libraries for common tasks helps ensure developers follow secure practices by default.
   - **Rollout Strategy**: Introducing new secure frameworks requires a careful rollout strategy. Google’s experience shows that using secure types from the start minimizes vulnerabilities. Rolling out changes incrementally, particularly in large codebases, is advised to prevent disruptions .

### 4. **Simplicity Leads to Secure and Reliable Code**
   - **Avoid Multilevel Nesting**: Deeply nested code is prone to errors and harder to maintain. Refactoring nested code improves readability and reduces potential bugs.
   - **Eliminate YAGNI Smells**: Following the "You Aren’t Gonna Need It" principle helps avoid over-engineering. Avoid adding unnecessary complexity in anticipation of future requirements .
   - **Repay Technical Debt**: Accumulating technical debt—e.g., through quick fixes or workarounds—can lead to long-term issues. It's important to regularly refactor and address known problems.

### 5. **Security and Reliability by Default**
   - **Choose the Right Tools**: Use well-established tools that handle security concerns, such as cryptographic libraries.
   - **Use Strong Types**: Strong types make security assumptions explicit and prevent unsafe actions by design. This strategy is particularly useful for avoiding injection vulnerabilities.
   - **Sanitize Your Code**: Code sanitization is crucial, especially when handling user inputs in web applications, to prevent vulnerabilities like XSS  .

This chapter emphasizes proactive strategies for ensuring that code is both secure and reliable, focusing on simplicity, secure defaults, and continuous improvement through refactoring.
